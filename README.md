**************
Stretch goals:

1. offer temperature conversion between C and F and mph to km/h

2. optimize 'results' page for narrow screens < 1000 px

3. create collections of cat pictures for each weather type so users get more variety

4. if result of locationSearch has an array length of 1, go immediately to results page (instead of having to click city name)
